# Grabbit

Grabbit is a simple URL scraper, to return the best Thumbnail image(s) to represent the content on the page. Grabbit also returns the page Title, and Description.
This Gem was inspired by Facebook: When you share a URL on Facebook in a post, FB goes off in the background and pulls the title, description, and best thumbnail image(s) to accompany your post. This gem is a simple scraper to do the same.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'grabbit'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install grabbit


## How it works

Grabbit uses HTTParty to grab the remote page, and then uses Nokogiri to parse the document to return the data. 

### Finding the Title

Grabbit works on the following precedence to find the Title of the page:

> 1. Look for Facebook og:title meta-tag first. See http://ogp.me/
> 2. Look for a Twitter Card twitter:title meta-tag. See https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards
> 3. Use the contents of the <title> tags.

		

## Usage

		scrape = Grabbit.url("https://github.com")

		if scrape
			scrape.title = "GitHub Â· Build software better, together."
			scrape.description = "Build software better, together."
			scrape.images = ["https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/modules/logos_page/Octocat.png"]
			scrape.images.first = "https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/modules/logos_page/Octocat.png"
		end
